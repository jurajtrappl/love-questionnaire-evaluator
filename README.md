# love-questionnaire-evaluator
I helped my friend to automatically collect, evaluate and visually process Google Form responses using Python and Google Forms API. The goal is to conveniently and quickly find suitable respondents for the interviews.

Form contains [Dyadic Adjustment Scale](http://www.trieft.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dyadic-Adjustment-Scale.pdf) and [Sternberg's triangular love scale](http://www.kordoutis.gr/STLS.pdf) tests. For both, I've written evaluations and they can be found in files *das.py* and *stls.py* respectively. 

The language of the form is Czech.
